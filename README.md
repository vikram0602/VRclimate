Project 4 : VR application that shows Impact of litter on environment and humans ,shown to engender social empathy in people .
Explanation : In this project , our aim was to derive social empathy in our users toward saving the vital and limited resources offered by the nature.There are many vital resources but our idea in this project whirls around saving water from getting contaminated by stopping activities like littering, outflow of harmful and toxic chemicals from industries that are not only effecting humans ,but also effecting marine life for aquatic animals. Our VR application introduces two decision process for the user to see the accelerated future based on the decision made earlier .
                                 ---------------------------Decision Model ---------------------------
decisionmodel (1)
 

>>Firstly Where the user watch a random guy litter just anywhere on the ground , user get two options here either he can go and pick the trash and put that into dumpster or he could just walk away,minding his own work. Both of these decision could prompt two different  scenarios as follows :

 A) If he picks others trash ,then he is approached by a random character which in our case plays the role of a scientist . He would express how glad he feels that there are some people who still cares for saving the beauty of the planet and its valuable heritage.In this virtual human interaction user would again be prompted for a decision when scientist guy would ask him if he would want to take a flyer or not .Flyer states something about a protest going near by to shutdown the oil industry which is polluting water.

B) If he just walk away he would again be approached by scientist where he would be lambaste the user for not caring about the safety of the earth and would still offer him a flyer and tries to make him aware what littering could cost the human race in the future.

>>Secondly he would watch a protest where few people are raising their voice against the industrial wastage running into the water and trying to get their proposed agenda of closing the factory signed by the government. Another virtual human who is the leader of the protest will talk with the user and ask him to sign the bill and join the protest .On the same side our third virtual human comes into picture who is the manager of the industry where he tries to convince the user that industry is doing nothing wrong , if this industry shuts down there will be many unemployed people who would suffers the most.Here in this decision process he could either sign the bill and join the protest or he could just agree with the manager of the firm and just walk away.
Based on these decision application simulates two accelerated future : Good future and Bad future

>>>In good future after picking trash and joining the protest in the decisions made before user would be able to see the impact on the environment , no litter on the ground  and industry would be closed. Drinking water would be more clean and aquatic life would be serene and no disease chaos would be seen .

>>>In bad future after ignoring the trash and protest , user would be able to see the dreadful diseases spread making the chaos in the city . Tap water would be toxic, aquatic life would be extinct as water gets highly toxic .
Motivation : Over the past few decades environment has been under alarming situations just because of carefree attitude of the humans. Humans are not just concerned about the resources wastage but they have happened to make the available resources like water of no more use for future generation by  spilling litter , toxic chemicals .With that practice in place for few more decades would totally destroy natural habitats and resources and there will be chaos all over the world which would finally mark the end of every species that ever lived on this planet.There have been many scientific research which estimates the end of the world if people don't change their lifestyle .By this VR application we want to increase awareness in people how they could contribute in keeping the human species alive by saving the resources and not spoil them. Through this we have very high expectations that looking at the bad future user would engender social empathy that could bring a new life to this world just as same as one might dream of. There are studies showing the relation between droughts and water over-consumption, as well as studies that prove how littering, such river contamination can kill animals and plants.

Water pollution by Industrial toxic outflow  : Effluents from industrial or municipal sources may contain hundreds to thousands of chemicals.

Littering Is Everyone's Problem :  Litter is an eyesore that pollutes the earth and costs a fortune to clean up.

Empathy : Looking at both the accelerated future Good and bad , we expect our user to take away the will to save the planet limited resources and realize the consequences that seems so dreadful that could make big chaos in the whole world and marks the end of every living species that ever lived on this planet.In the trash picking scenario we expect the user to be enthusiastic in volunteering the task of picking someone's trash and get some awareness by scientist guy in case he doesn't pick up trash. In protest scene we expect the user to take a good decision of signing the bill and join the protest though this way he should have a second thought about the industry workers who would get unemployed. At last user is expected to get a very firm insight about the vulnerability of the environment and human life together.
